# GenshinArtifactOptimizer

**Usage**: Pick the character, weapon and effects that you want to optimize your damage for, then run allocate_stats in the appropriate damage model 
to determine which artifact stats/substats need to be allocated. For examples, refer to `examples.py`.

**Note**: Characters, weapons and effects are defined in the bin folder. Add entries to the files to be able to use the optimizer for them.
